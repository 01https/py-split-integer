# Check Your Code Against the Following Points

## Code Style

1. Use descriptive and correct variable names.

Good example:

```python
def get_full_name(first_name: str, last_name: str) -> str:
    return f"{first_name} {last_name}"
```

Bad example:
```python
def get_full_name(x: str, y: str) -> str:
    return f"{x} {y}"
```

2. Make sure that you compare the result of function and expected result in `assert` statement.

## Clean Code

Add comments, prints, and functions to check your solution when you write your code. 
Don't forget to delete them when you are ready to commit and push your code.
